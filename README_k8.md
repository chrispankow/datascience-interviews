__NOTE__: Most interviews will not do this, only if specifically requested.

For the second half of the interview, we will be asking some questions about the kubernetes manifest contained in this repo. It can also be found at https://gist.github.com/chodosm/099e03557a592dde317f9fd24f3ac4f6 Please review it before the interview. You can expect a few questions about basic concepts within the configuration file, as well as a few troubleshooting scenarios.
